# GRIP-September-2022-task-1
this is the first task of my data science and business analytics internship at the Sparks Foundation.  This is a simple prediction model using supervised ML.

We are to build a regression model which will predict the percentage of a student on the number of study hours. Here Scores refers to the percentage of marks obtained by the student and Hours refers to the number of hours a student studies in a day.

Scores is the response variable or dependent variable and Hours is the explanatory variable or the independent variable. The entire process and the code is explained in the R markdown file grip-01
